    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dish that the whole family will love. You will want to share this with friends and even neighbors as this meal
        will bring &ldquo;home-cooked&rdquo; back to reality.</p>
    <p>This meal only takes about 45 minutes to an hour, but it will taste like it has been simmering all day just to be
        cooked to perfection.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
        <li>3 large carrots, peeled and chopped (about 1&frac12; cup)</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>&frac14; cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1&frac12; lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-in pieces</li>
        <li>1 tsp chopped, fresh thyme</li>
        <li>&frac12; tsp kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>&frac12; tsp black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 lb dried gnocchi</li>
        <li>1 5oz container of baby spinach, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fire up the Dutch oven, medium heat. Oil in, then hit it with onion, carrot, and celery. Stir &lsquo;em up,
            let &lsquo;em soften&mdash;10 to 12 minutes. Toss in the garlic at the last minute. No mercy for burnt
            garlic.</li>
        <li>Dump in the flour, stir like you mean it. Coat those veggies, one minute max. Slow-roll the broth in, bring
            it to a simmer. Chicken, thyme, salt, pepper&mdash;all in. Back to a simmer, then dial it down to
            medium-low. Let the chicken cook through, 5 minutes. No shortcuts.</li>
        <li>Gnocchi goes in next. Cover, stir now and then, until they&rsquo;re tender and fluffy&mdash;4 to 5 minutes.
            Spinach and half-and-half follow. Stir, let it marry up, 1 to 2 minutes. Kill the heat. Taste. Salt and
            pepper as needed. Done.</li>
    </ol>
