# Odin Recipes

This is my first web development project as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Project Purpose
To practice fundamental HTML concepts, including:
- Creating a multi-page website
- Using semantic HTML elements
- Organizing files and directories
- Linking between pages
- Version control with Git and GitHub

## Skill Demonstrated
- HTML5 structure and boilerplate
- Headings, lists, and text formatting
- Image and link implementation
- Basic project organization

## Initial Plan
1. Create `index.html` with a list of recipes
2. Build individual recipe pages (e.g, `lasagna.html`)
3. Use relative links to connect all pages
4. Host on GitHub Pages

_I will update this README upon completion to reflect what I learned and any challenges faced._
